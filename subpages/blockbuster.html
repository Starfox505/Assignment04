        <p>
            Tarantino's first true blockbuster film was 
            <i>Inglorious Basterds</i>, which is one of his most well known and 
            most loved film he's made. This film features an enormous cast, great 
            special effects, some of the best camerawork and editing in film, and 
            of course one of the best Tarantino scripts to date. While originally 
            he wanted to make this into a mini-series, another director approached 
            him and told him how disappointed he was that his next project wasn't 
            in theaters. Therefore, he re-wrote the script and made it very 
            different. Regardless of the story being in film or tv format, it was 
            widely accepted and loved. In fact, the film's budget was $70 million 
            and the film grossed $321.4 million!

        <h2 id="django-unchained">Django Unchained</h2>    
        <img class="centered-movie-image" src="../images/Django.jpg" alt="A poster for the film Django Unchained. There is black chains on a red background with two sillouette men walking."/>
        <p>
            He then followed up with his first western <i>Django Unchained</i>, 
            which features some of the best acting in Tarantino's films to date. 
            It also features a lot larger sets, stuns, and pyrotechnics, which 
            gets shown off in many scenes in the film. While the film cost $100 
            million to make, this film grossed $435.4 million making this 
            Tarantino's highest grossing film to date!
        </p>
        <h2 id="the-hateful-eight">The Hateful Eight</h2>
        <img class="centered-movie-image" src="../images/Hateful.jpg" alt="A poster for the film The Hateful Eight. It is a black stagecoach on a white snowy background with a trail of red following the stagecoach."/>
        <p>
            He then moved on to make another western film called 
            <i>The Hateful Eight</i>. However, this film differed heavily from the 
            <i>Django Unchained</i>, as this film primarily takes place in one 
            cabin. Therefore, this film is a lot more condensed as far as set and 
            the scale of the story as well. While certain fans of Tarantino raved 
            about the film, it had plenty of poor reviews as well from fans. This 
            is mainly due to the gratuitous violence, the slow movie story, and 
            some viewers felt the character were to plain. Nonetheless, the film 
            grossed about $155.8 million and only cost roughly $50 million to 
            make.
