        <h2 id="kill-bill"> Kill Bill Series</h2>    
        <img class="centered-movie-image" src="../images/Bill.jpg" alt="This is a poster for Kill Bill Volume 1 and 2. It is an extremely colorful and Japanese styled poster with many different characters who are blooded. Many of the characters are wielding samurai swords."/>

            <i>Kill Bill Volume 1 and 2</i> were released a year apart, and were 
            filmed back to back. This film once again won audiences over with the 
            incredibly complex choreographed action scenes, beautiful color 
            schemes, and once again a perfect soundtrack and script, as well as an 
            unforgettable set of characters. The films cost about $60 million 
            collectively to make, but the film combine grossed about $333.1 
            million!

        <p>
            His last indie film he made was <i>Deathproof</i> which is still 
            regarded as one of his most outrageous and risky film to date. This 
            film featured a female stunt double to carry the film as the lead in 
            the latter half of the film. This film was also the second part of a 
            two part movie project that he and his good friend and filmmaker 
            Robert Rodriguez were working on. While the films have nearly no 
            correlation with each other, they are both slasher films they both 
            desperately wanted to make. While the film is extremely well known, 
            this film has a massive cult following, even thought film was made on 
            a $30 million budget and only made $30.7 million.
