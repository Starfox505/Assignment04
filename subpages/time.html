            While <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i> is Tarantino's last film 
            released, it is one of the most important films in his career.
            Tarantino wrote this film so in-depth, that many of the characters 
            backgrounds are not even shown or talked about in the film. Instead, 
            he told the actors directly what their characters have been through in 
            extensive detail. The main cast were given booklets about themselves 
            to study and help get them into character. He also shot about five 20 
            minutes episodes of a series he made up for the series. However, these 
            episodes are only previewed extremely briefly in the film. This also 
            featured some of the biggest stars in Hollywood currently, and a lot 
            of really obscure but endearing Hollywood callbacks. While this will 
            go over most viewers heads, many Tarantino and hardcore movie fans 
            will understand his sentiment and vision, as he grew up in the late 
            60s watching these stars and films he references. This film's budget was 
            $90 million and grossed about $374.6 million.

It features three pictures of a man in a cowboy hat, a woman thinking in a chair with a pen in her mouth and her feet up, and a man with sunglasses looking out a car window with his hand on the top of the car."/>

            In fact, Tarantino was so inspired by the story that he wrote his 
            first novelization. While the reviews were mixed, a lot of fans 
            appreciated the immense background on characters and stories. While 
            this is his first book, he stated on the Joe Rogan Podcast he plans 
            to make a few books and stage productions before his last feature film.
