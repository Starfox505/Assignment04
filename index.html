                The directors first film was <i>Reservoir Dogs</i> was made for $1.2
                million and only grossed $2.9 million. However, over time this film 
                blew up, as it featured some very realistic, gritty, and pop culture 
                filled dialogue. It also has such a wild and twisted story, which 
                features some very violent and surprising twists throughout the film.

            <p>
                After his first feature film's success, he followed up with
                <i>Pulp Fiction</i>, which is still regarded as one of the greatest
                and most quoted films of all time. With a stellar cast, the now
                stylized Tarantino dialogue and editing techniques, and a killer 
                soundtrack this film won audiences over time and time again. While the 
                film only cost $2 million to make it grossed $213.9 million!

                His third feature film he made was <i>Jackie Brown</i>. This film cost 
                $12 million and grossed $74.7, and while it did do well in  the box 
                office the film received a lot of mixed reviews. However, it developed 
                a large cult following after its release. This film also notably got 
                Chris Tucker his job for the Rush Hour series, even though he is only 
                featured in about 10 minutes of the film.

                <i>Kill Bill Volume 1 and 2</i> were released a year apart, and were 
                filmed back to back. This film once again won audiences over with the 
                incredibly complex choreographed action scenes, beautiful color 
                schemes, and once again a perfect soundtrack and script, as well as an 
                unforgettable set of characters. The films cost about $60 million 
                collectively to make, but the film combine grossed about $333.1 
                million!

            <p>
                His last indie film he made was <i>Deathproof</i> which is still 
                regarded as one of his most outrageous and risky film to date. This 
                film featured a female stunt double to carry the film as the lead in 
                the latter half of the film. This film was also the second part of a 
                two part movie project that he and his good friend and filmmaker 
                Robert Rodriguez were working on. While the films have nearly no 
                correlation with each other, they are both slasher films they both 
                desperately wanted to make. While the film is extremely well known, 
                this film has a massive cult following, even thought film was made on 
                a $30 million budget and only made $30.7 million.

            <p>
                Tarantino's first true blockbuster film was 
                <i>Inglorious Basterds</i>, which is one of his most well known and 
                most loved film he's made. This film features an enormous cast, great 
                special effects, some of the best camerawork and editing in film, and 
                of course one of the best Tarantino scripts to date. While originally 
                he wanted to make this into a mini-series, another director approached 
                him and told him how disappointed he was that his next project wasn't 
                in theaters. Therefore, he re-wrote the script and made it very 
                different. Regardless of the story being in film or tv format, it was 
                widely accepted and loved. In fact, the film's budget was $70 million 
                and the film grossed $321.4 million!

            <p>
                He then followed up with his first western <i>Django Unchained</i>, 
                which features some of the best acting in Tarantino's films to date. 
                It also features a lot larger sets, stuns, and pyrotechnics, which 
                gets shown off in many scenes in the film. While the film cost $100 
                million to make, this film grossed $435.4 million making this 
                Tarantino's highest grossing film to date!

            <p>
                He then moved on to make another western film called 
                <i>The Hateful Eight</i>. However, this film differed heavily from the 
                <i>Django Unchained</i>, as this film primarily takes place in one 
                cabin. Therefore, this film is a lot more condensed as far as set and 
                the scale of the story as well. While certain fans of Tarantino raved 
                about the film, it had plenty of poor reviews as well from fans. This 
                is mainly due to the gratuitous violence, the slow movie story, and 
                some viewers felt the character were to plain. Nonetheless, the film 
                grossed about $155.8 million and only cost roughly $50 million to 
                make.

            <p>
                While <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i> is Tarantino's last film 
                released, it is one of the most important films in his career.
                Tarantino wrote this film so in-depth, that many of the characters 
                backgrounds are not even shown or talked about in the film. Instead, 
                he told the actors directly what their characters have been through in 
                extensive detail. The main cast were given booklets about themselves 
                to study and help get them into character. He also shot about five 20 
                minutes episodes of a series he made up for the series. However, these 
                episodes are only previewed extremely briefly in the film. This also 
                featured some of the biggest stars in Hollywood currently, and a lot 
                of really obscure but endearing Hollywood callbacks. While this will 
                go over most viewers heads, many Tarantino and hardcore movie fans 
                will understand his sentiment and vision, as he grew up in the late 
                60s watching these stars and films he references. This film's budget was 
                $90 million and grossed about $374.6 million.

            <img class="centered-movie-image" src="images/Cover.jpg" alt="This is the cover of the novelization of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. It features three pictures of a man in a cowboy hat, a woman thinking in a chair with a pen in her mouth and her feet up, and a man with sunglasses looking out a car window with his hand on the top of the car."/>
            <p>
                In fact, Tarantino was so inspired by the story that he wrote his 
                first novelization. While the reviews were mixed, a lot of fans 
                appreciated the immense background on characters and stories. While 
                this is his first book, he stated on the Joe Rogan Podcast he plans 
                to make a few books and stage productions before his last feature film.
